## Problem Statement

[RFE] Support union types specification using | (vertical bar/pipe)
Please add a support for specifying multiple types acceptable for a parameter/attribute/variable.
Use case:
Imagine that there is a function that accepts both `bytes` and `str`. The docstring would look like:

``` restructuredtext
def foo(text):
    """Bar

    :param text: a text
    :type text: bytes | str

    """
```

Such a syntax is already supported by e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html).

## Hints

From [the docs](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html#info-field-lists):
> Multiple types in a type field will be linked automatically if separated by the word “or”:

So this feature is already available using this syntax:

```python
def foo(foo):
    """
    Bla blu

    :type foo: str or int or None
    """
```

Instead of multiplying the possible syntaxes for this, why don't we try to adhere to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#union-types) and the [`typing` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union)? These are already Python standards that are readily available in modern Python releases. I wouldn't take PyCharm as a reference for this kind of stuff, as they seem to enjoy never following the community's common practices.

```python
def foo(foo):
    """
    Bla blu

    :type foo: Union[str, int, None]
    """
```
A lot of time has passed since I filed this issue. I don't remember whether I specifically wanted the pipe syntax or whether it was just an example... I certainly didn't know about that PEP and that module didn't exist at that time as far as I know... As well as the paragraph in the documentation that you have mentioned... And that PyCharm's syntax was, for sure, the only syntax I knew... Maybe it was a mistake to suggest a particular implementation...

Now, it's enough for me that there is a support for union types in Sphinx already...

## Task

Fix this issue in the sphinx codebase. The relevant source code is in the repository. Make the minimal change needed to resolve the bug described above. Do NOT modify or add test files — only fix the source code.
